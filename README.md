# This is a project for Coursera course: IBM backend development
- In this final project, we built a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which used authentication at the session level using JWT. We then **tested** our application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.
- The structure of the project is as follows:
```sh
|--README.md
|--index.js
|--package.json
|--router
|   |--auth_users.js
|   |--booksdb.js
|   |--general.js
```
